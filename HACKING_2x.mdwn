This document summarizes issues I have found while working offline on
Aegir 2.x on june 2012. It should be posted as a blog or something.

Install notes
=============

Those are notes from a manual install of Aegir 2.x using the Nginx
backend. I have taken those notes instead of filing bugs as this work
was done offline.

use sudo instead of su
----------------------

use the following instead of su aegir:

    sudo -u aegir -H /bin/bash

install drush through PEAR
--------------------------

we should follow Arch linux's lead and install drush through PEAR, as
it is upstream's suggestion.

aegir 2.x modifications
-----------------------

 1. install drush 5 instead of drush 4 (should be in the docs)
 2. we don't depend on drush make anymore, as it's in drush 5 core!!
 make sure we change the hostmaster-install help and process at the
 very least (done?)

other issues
------------

 * we should not talk about using a makefile if the hostmaster platform
   already exists
 * the aegir config file generates this nginx error:

    nginx on localhost could not be restarted. Changes might not be available until this has been done.  [warning]
    (error: Reloading nginx configuration: nginx: [emerg] "error_log" directive is duplicate in
    /etc/nginx/conf.d/aegir.conf:107

   (fixed)

 * install error:

    The hosting_platform_pathauto module is required but was not found. Please move it into the modules  [error]
    subdirectory.

   (fixed by removing said module, would need to be merged in)

 * the nginx config file is way too big, it sets policy, like hiding
   headers, SSL performance, gzip compression, size limits and so
   on. those do not belong in an aegir configuration file, and should
   at least be optional. the fastcgi_params are also duplicate of a
   file in /etc/nginx.conf

   (work started in the dev-nginx-cleanup branch)

 * out of the box, nginx shows "bad gateway" error when following the
   login link - fix:
   
    diff --git a/php5/fpm/pool.d/www.conf b/php5/fpm/pool.d/www.conf
    index 28a0651..e6d552d 100644

   not sure how to fix this

 * the nginx includes may fail on remote servers because
   /var/aegir/config/includes may not be rsync'd to remote servers

 * the nginx advanced and simple configuration are almost exactly the
   same minus about 10 lines of diff - they should include each other
   instead of duplicating stuff

   (fixed in cleanup branch)

things i forgot
---------------

 * forgot to clone pkg-drush
 * forgot to install the nginx-doc package
 * forgot to install ab or siege (crap)

offline hacks
-------------

I had to go through a few hoops to make this work offline. To install
drush, i worked from a previous clone I had lying around:

    sudo aegir -H git clone ~anarcat/src/drush
    sudo ln -s /var/aegir/drush/drush /usr/local/bin/drush

And the same for provision:

    sudo aegir -H git clone ~anarcat/src/provision .drush/provision --branch 6.x-2.x

Then for the frontend (trickier), I had to fiddle around with also a
previously existing hostmaster platform:

    git clone ~anarcat/src/drupal hostmaster-6.x-2.x --branch 6.26
    git clone ~anarcat/src/hostmaster hostmaster-6.x-2.x/profiles/hostmaster --branch 6.x-2.x
    cd hostmaster-6.x-2.x/profiles/hostmaster
    cp -a ~/hostmaster-6.x-1.x/profiles/hostmaster/modules/{admin_menu,install_profile_api,jquery_ui,modalframe,openidadmin} modules

Multiserver redesign
====================

One of the things I have been thinking of doing for a while was to
move the dispatcher to the backend and move more logic to remote
servers. This section details my findings related to that work

Task queue
----------

This queue is tightly bound with the frontend. There's a complete
'task' module, complete with a database schema, in the hosting
package. It would be difficult if not illogical to move all that stuff
to the provision module.

This, in turn, makes it difficult to implement the task queue on the
remote servers directly.

An alternative would be to keep the task module in the frontend but
create a skeleton implementation in the backend that would do the task
unserialization necessary to produce the drush task.

In other words, we would need to split the task module in two: one
part which would write tasks to the MySQL database (by default, other
backends could be implemented!) and another end (on the provision
side), which would read tasks from the database.

The dispatcher
--------------

The dispatcher, however, is less bound with the frontend. It uses the
Drupal variable storage for locking itself, but that is probably not a
blocker for moving the code to the backend.

In fact, we could consider simply dropping all this code in favor of
the more stable, complete and logical hosting_queued.

Settings for the queues that are used by the dispatcher could still be
managed by the frontend, provided we clearly specify which settings
are applied of course. Again, those settings are specific to our MySQL
"ghetto queue" implementation and could be extended to support other
queuing systems.

Multiple queue support
----------------------

Moving the dispatcher code to the backend would have the advantage of
allowing that logic to be moved out of the main site, and allow to
have multiple queues, for example one per server.

For this, we would need to have a server column to separate the queues
directly in the SQL tables. This, in turn, would duplicate the server
information, which is already in the hosting_site/platform/server
tables. In other words, maybe this information should be fetched
through a JOIN instead.

Aliases location
----------------

Regardless, that information is also duplicated in the drush aliases,
which would need to be synced to remote servers anyways. One of the
reason for the hub/spoke model is that it makes it much easier to find
where a site is - you just look in the alias and there you are, you
log into that server and you do your things.

Having a queue per server would probably mean completely removing
certain aliases, specifically the server aliases, which could mean
problem for slave servers in the 'pack' cluster module.

The cron queue
--------------

The cron queue is an odd anomaly in all this. It is the only known
implementation of the "batch" queue (although there is talk of
implementing a civicrm cron queue). It also happens to oddly duplicate
and overlap the functionality of the builtin cron daemon, which it
depends on.

My thought is currently to *not* duplicate the functionality of cron
(which we depend on *anyways* - we do not want to reimplement this in
hosting_queued I believe) and instead start looking at writing cron
jobs individually to the crontab. This could be done in the verify
task of sites.

Unfortunately, the crontab command doesn't feature a locking
mechanism, which means we will have to implement our own to avoid
overwriting changes if we ever allow some tasks to be ran in parallel.

Nevertheless, this seems like a much simpler implementation that would
also allow per-task cron periods.

The provision context engine
============================

**Otherwise known as "d(), the aliases, the contexts and the nature of
the universe".**

Anyone who has gotten into Aegir sufficiently deep will have
encountered the Provision_Context class and the d() function. Some
blogs were written about it to explain a little what it does, but it
was mostly limited to how to use it, not really how to extend it.

The limitations of d() (thee?)
------------------------------

There are significant limitations to this framework. First off, it is
*confusing*: no programmer I have known to get into the project have
fully gotten their head wrapped around the idea of the provision
contexts.

Second, it *overlaps* with a lot of existing functionality in Drush,
in name or in essence. The provision contexts extend the Drush aliases
to provide automatic saving of the aliases, but also generation of
configuration files based on templates. That is interesting in itself,
but has never been integrated upstream and no one, as far as I know,
ever dared to start doing this. Besides, all the work for this is done
by provision-save command, which is mostly a stub that serialises
drush options into an alias.

It also overlaps, in name, with the Drush contexts, which are
themselves confusing, as there are two things called drush
contexts. The first one is `drush_get_context()` which is really a way
to store static data in Drush, and should be renamed
`drush_get_static()`. The second one *uses* the static storage to
provide a hierarchical storage mechanism for drush options, which
include the site/platform/etc drushrc files, the drush aliases, and so
on.

Third, it *duplicates information* between the context storage
(ie. the alias), the frontend (MySQL) database *and* the generated
config files. The latter could arguably be excused, since the
alternative would be write write a parser for all config files we
generate, which can be a pain in the butt. However, the duplication
between the frontend database and the drush aliases is a real
problem.

The original idea behind the aliases was to be a step towards
storing data "in the cloud", or more precisely, in a key-value storage
system like Redis. The fact that the implementation is incomplete is
due to the departure of our founder, and we need to take care of this
problem for things to make sense again.

Fourth, it *conflicts* with Drush's alias semantics. By using FQDNs as
the alias name, we are looking for trouble. Drush aliases can be
multiple per site, so you can have site @example with an alias
@example.prod and @example.dev, ie. the separator for those multiple
aliases is the dot, just like domain names.

Aegir currently only defines one alias per site, but this could get
really confusing, at the very least, for users coming from a Drush
universe with a heavy use of shell aliases. Worst case, it will create
situations where the wrong site is being used for tasks.

The future of d()
-----------------

(Okay I'll stop with the puns.)

It is clear that we need to reshuffle this code. My first reflex is to
simply scrap this and start from scratch. This could be coherent with
the earlier thoughts on removing some aliases (the @server aliases,
more specifically) and the reworking of the queuing system, which is
what this all depends on in the end.

If we can access the data stored in the MySQL database directly, we
may not need aliases at all, or more precisely, drush aliases could be
generated on the fly based on MySQL credentials given to the Aegir
user (or other users!) that would give the user access to the frontend
data.

No need to provision-save anymore - the aliases would be loaded from
the DB on the fly. This may also allows us to get rid of the
"arguments" column in the hosting task table (for certain tasks like
install at the very least), something that shouldn't be neglected.

The future of config file generation
------------------------------------

This is the one sticky bit that is not covered and requires the
Provision_Context class to remain. The class allows developers to
specify configuration file templates to generate based on the context
variables, which is very useful.

This is something that we may want to integrate into Drush, but not in
its current state. It would probably need to be wrapper around Drush's
concept of aliases more tightly and more simply. This may yet mean
just extending the current alias code with a class, as we do now,
unfortunately (as we are building a OO framework on top of a non-OO
tangle).

I am still unclear as to what the next step is for the backend, but
hopefully this will yield to some discussions and new ideas.
